I have been prepared for GSoC under R Organization. The project name is 
bugRzilla helping R community in submitting issues to R. BugZilla have two 
fold goal. First is to access the data of R issue tracker. Second is make it 
easier to interect with it from R itself. 

This GSoC project is focus on second goal.
